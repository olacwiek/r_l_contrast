# Data preparation - From Aleksandra Ćwiek

```{r pckgs}
#library(tidyverse)

# Set the script's path as working directory
parentfolder = rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path 
#setwd(dirname(parentfolder))
parentfolder <- getwd()

data <- paste0(parentfolder, '/data/')
```

Load the data

```{r load data}
web <- read.csv(paste0(data, "r_l_web.csv"), sep = ",")
```

## Web dataset cleaning

Before cleaning we have `r length(unique(web$l1))` languages in the column `l1`.  
Before cleaning we have `r length(unique(web$l2))` languages in the column `l2`.  
Before cleaning we have `r length(unique(web$firstlanguage))` languages in the column `firstlanguage`.  
Before cleaning we have `r length(unique(web$foreignlanguages))` combinations for languages in the column `foreignlanguages`.  
For the data coding, I won't work with `firstlanguage` column and `foreignlanguages`.

```{r}
#I looked languages that have not a language name (some are Aleksandra trials)
to_del <- c("b","q","3","hi") 

web <- web %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!(l1 %in% to_del) & !is.na(l1))

languages <- web %>% 
                dplyr::mutate(L1 = stringr::str_extract_all(l1, "\\b[:alpha:]+\\b"),
                             L2 = stringr::str_extract_all(l2, "\\b[:alpha:]+\\b")) 

#Some of the languages have been replaced based on Aleksandra's preparation script
#The objective here is to have a maximum of languages to code

languages_data <- unique(c(unlist(languages$L1),unlist(languages$L2))) %>% 
                as.data.frame() %>% 
                dplyr::rename(Languages = 1) %>% 
                dplyr::mutate(Languages = as.character(Languages)) %>% 
                dplyr::distinct() %>% 
                dplyr::filter(!is.na(Languages) & Languages != "a" & Languages != "little" & Languages != "bit") %>% 
                dplyr::mutate(Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'isizulu', 'zulu'),
                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'turkce', 'turkish'),
                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'albanianja', 'albanian'),
                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'español', 'spanish'),
                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'italia', 'italian'),

                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'spanich', 'spanish'),
                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'calatan', 'catalan'),

                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'dari', 'farsi'),
                              Languages = stringr::str_replace(Languages, 'sami', 'saami')) %>% 
                dplyr::distinct() %>% 
                dplyr::arrange(Languages) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(glottocode = as.character(NA),
                r_l_distinction = as.integer(NA),
                trill_real = as.integer(NA),
                trill_occ = as.integer(NA))

```

In total, we have `r length(unique(languages_data$Languages))` languages to check.

              R is trilled in Afrikaans. In various areas of the Cape uvular r, both [R] and [ʁ], occurs and in the north is regarded as a shibboleth of a "Capie" (see               footnote 9). It is called gebryde r, e.g. Hy bry, want hy kom van Malmesbury se wêreld αf 'He has a uvular r because he comes from the Malmesbury area'.  
  - Footnote 9 Page 6 : If one wants to parody a Transvaler, one uses this sound, whereas the countryside of the Western Cape is parodied by using the uvular r and raising ee and oo to [i] and [u], e.g. lees [lis] 'to read', brood [bRut]'bread'.

  - Page 132 : In colloquial speech, the voiced alveolar trill /r/ tends to be omitted in syllable-final position. This happens mostly in unstressed syllables, and regularly in the prefix ver-, as in /fərˈkeːrd/ > [fəkiərt] verkeerd ‘wrong’. In word-final position, as in /lɛkər/ > [lækə] lekker ‘nice’, /r/-deletion is quite common across the board, especially in function words like daar, maar, hier, vir: /daːr/ > [daː] daar ‘there’, /maːr/ > [maː]7 maar ‘but’, /foːr/ > [fuə] voor ‘in front of’, and /fər/ > [fə] vir8 ‘for’. This phenomena is widely present in Malayan Afrikaans. Kotz ́e (1983) mentions similar examples, but adds to these the loss of /r/, even in complex codas, e.g. [fəket] verkeerd ‘wrong’, [bɔːs] bors ‘breast’, and [kənəs] kinders ‘children’ –transcriptions are Kotz ́e’s.

  - Flap 			ɾ 					  
    Trill 			r  
  - The contrast between flapped r and trilled rr is the almost the same as in Spanish or Armenian. However, in most of the dialects, as also in standard Albanian, the single "r" changes from an alveolar flap /ɾ/ to an alveolar approximant [ɹ].

  - Page 8 :  Rhotics  
              Northern Tosk contrasts two rhotics, written as ⟨r⟩ and ⟨rr⟩, both of which can occur word initially, medially and finally. While our speakers always realised ⟨rr⟩ as an alveolar trill [r], ⟨r⟩ was characterised by a great deal of allophonic variation, as also previously noted by Belluscio (Reference Belluscio, Gesuato and Grazia Busà2014). Among the range of realisations for ⟨r⟩, we found retroflex flaps [ɽ] and retroflex approximants [ɻ]. These seem to be in complementary distribution, with [ɻ] tending to appear in coda position, although for some speakers and in some words, word-initial /r/ was also realised as a retroflex approximant [ɻ]. Impressionistic studies and some case-study analyses suggest that /r/ may increasingly be realised as [ɻ] or variants thereof in different varieties of Albanian (Hysenaj Reference Hysenaj2009, Jubani-Bengu Reference Jubani-Bengu2012, Belluscio Reference Belluscio2016). Figure 8 shows illustrative examples of the three main rhotic allophones. The limited set of contexts in the words collected does not allow us to make definitive generalisations about the distribution of these allophones and future work is warranted on this matter. We have chosen to use /r/ for ⟨rr⟩ and /ɽ/ for ⟨r⟩, though as noted above, /ɽ/ is frequently realised as [ɻ].

At the beginning of a word (and in somecases in the middle of a word), this sound was pronouncedwith aspiration (hence word-initial rho is always written \rho(avec diacritic au dessus])).

  - Trill 			r^[l]
  - [l] Emphatic [rˤ] exists in Northwestern African pronunciations and in Egypt when accompanied by /a/ or /u/ and plain when accompanied by /i/ or /j/; in closed syllables, then it is plain when the first preceding voweled consonant has /i/ or if /j/ is present, but emphatic if the first preceding voweled letter is accompanied by /a/ or /u/. The trill /r/ is sometimes reduced to a single vibration when single, but it remains potentially a trill, not a flap [ɾ]: the pronunciation of this single trill is between a trill [r] and a flap [ɾ]. ⟨r⟩ is in free variation between a trill [r] and a flap [ɾ] in Egypt and the Levant.

The flap [ɾ] can be found in all positions, whereas the distribution of trill [r] is comparatively restricted.  
The trill [r] seldom occurs in the initial position, with the exception of some words among that ṙus [rus] “Russian” and its derivations as well as of loans with initial trill [r], [...]. In medial position, trill r [r] occurs frequently [...].

            [5] The Armenian tap has a fricative variant in syllable codas, discussed in Sonorants. We chose the tap as the basic symbol because (i) the tap has a wider distribution, (ii) a tap spirantization process seems more phonetically natural than a fricative tapping process, (iii) coauthor PG reports that some Armenian varieties do not have a fricative variant, and (iv) the tap follows the convention in Armenian linguistics literature.

  - Page 15 : The rhotics /r, R/ are contrastive in Yerevan Armenian, with minimal pairs such as the following:
              [examples]
               forms and in emphatic speech.Footnote 8 For example, SK’s recordings contrast /ˈseɾ/ and /ˈser/ primarily via louder frication noise for the tap /ɾ/ with a low spectral peak around 4 kHz (perhaps non-sibilant postalveolar fricative [ɹ̝̊])Footnote 9. However, word-final /ɾ/ is often unambiguously tapped or approximated in connected speech, such as in the accompanying recordings of the North Wind and Sun by HD and SK (see Transcription of recorded passage). Tap and approximant variants are both common in intervocalic position. The recordings of /kʰɑˈɾi/ ‘rock (DAT.GEN)’ and /χɑˈɾisχ/ ‘anchor’ contributed by SK illustrate approximant variants of /ɾ/.

The recording of /ˈser/ is not trilled, but has a falling third formant that is excited by aspiration without voicing, and only weak or absent oral frication noise. Most of the coda trills in the accompanying recordings contributed by SK are voiceless and/or spirantized. For example, the recording of /ˈ t͡sɑr/ ‘tree’ in the section Vowels (below) includes a voiceless trill, while the recording of the same word in the Consonants table is more similar to the variant in /ˈser/. A voiced trill coda is illustrated in the recording of /ˈkor/ ‘coerced labor (archaic)’, from the speaker who contributed /ˈkoʁ/ ‘rib’ in the subsection Yerevan Armenian plosives.

Although the two rhotics are contrastive in Yerevan Armenian, the tap is sometimes trilled before coronals (Xačatryan Reference Xačatryan1988: 108; Vaux Reference Vaux1998: 19; also noted by speaker VP), and word-initial trills are often reduced to the tap.Footnote 10

In Western Armenian, both sounds are merged to the tap /ɾ/ in all environments (Vaux Reference Vaux1998), though they are prescriptively taught as contrastive in Canadian Armenian language schools (Talia Tahtadjian, p.c.) and some Western Armenian dictionaries (Sak’apetoyean Reference Sak’apetoyean2011; also in Fairbanks Reference Fairbanks1948). For the Western Armenian community in Canada, Tahtadjian (Reference Tahtadjian2020) reports that the Western Armenian tap and trill are acoustically distinguishable: the Western trill sometimes has multiple articulator contacts (occurring in about 30 of onset trills produced by older speakers, and <15 of other trills), and the trill is about 2 ms longer in onset position and 4 ms longer in coda position. These differences are probably too small or too variable to reliably index a category difference. In the accompanying recording of Beirut Armenian [rɑzmɑˈɡɑn] ‘military’ contributed by HD, the onset consonant has multiple contacts, but HD indicates that the tap and trill were perceptually indistinguishable for his peer group in a Lebanese Armenian school.

In both dialects, the two rhotics are rare word-initially. While there are some native rhotic-initial words such as Yerevan /rɑmkɑˈkɑn/ ‘democratic’, most such words are names like Yerevan /rɑfɑˈjel/ ‘Raphael (name)’ and borrowings such as Yerevan /rɑˈbi/ ‘rabbi’. For these words, the Beirut forms use a tap instead of the trill: /ɾɑmɡɑˈɡɑn/, /ɾɑfɑˈjel/ (), /ɾɑˈpʰi/. Both rhotics are more frequent medially and finally, and occur in Yerevan minimal pairs such as the above.

Most sources treat /j/ as phonemic (in contrast with Vaux Reference Vaux1998), though it has a limited distribution. In word-initial position, the palatal approximant /j/ primarily occurs before /e/, such as in /ˈjeɾpʰ/ ‘when’ (see Vaux Reference Vaux1998: 13 for a phonological analysis and Dum-Tragut Reference Dum-Tragut2009: 14–17 for a lexical catalog; see also Vowels). All attested word-initial /jɑ/ are borrowings, such as /ˈjɑvɾəm/ , ‘my dear’ from Turkish. It is also found word-initially before the back vowels /u/ and /o/ in a handful of native words, such as /ˈjuʁ/ , ‘oil’ and /ˈjotʰə/ , ‘seven’. In some words, the Yerevan Armenian sequence /ju/ is pronounced [ʏ] in Beirut Armenian, though there is substantial variation (Khanjian Reference Khanjian2011). For example, Yerevan /ˈɡjuʁ/ ‘village’ corresponds to Beirut [ˈkʰʏʁ] ∼ [ˈkʰjʏʁ] ∼ [ˈkʰjuʁ] .

In native words, coda /j/ does not appear after /ə/, or word-finally after /i/ or /u/. It occurs in native complex codas only after /ɑ/ and /u/, such as in /ˈhɑjɾ/ ‘father’. Word-medially, /Cj/ sequences may have ambiguous onset syllabification (Margaryan Reference Margaryan1997: 55), such as in Yerevan /sen.jɑk, se.njɑk/ and Beirut /sen.jɑɡ, se.njɑɡ/ ‘room’ (see also Syllable structure).

  - Page 340 : Trill r
              The table presents the consonant phonemes of SAG. A speaker-specific representation has to be assumed regarding the trill. The chart lists both the uvular trill and the alveolar trill. Most speakers make use of a uvular production (either trill or fricative). However, for those speakers who exclusively apply an alveolar production (either trill or approximant), /r/ has to be assumed.
  - Page 341 : /ʀ/ [ˈʁoːsɛ] Rose ‘rose’
                   [ˈleːɐʁɐ] Lehrer ‘teacher’
                   
              SAG features a wide variety of realisations of the trill. In approximately the past 40 years, the pronunciation norm has changed from an alveolar to a uvular trill. The latter is mostly pronounced as a fricative, either voiced or voiceless. Alveolar trills are still in use, mostly pronounced as an approximant. In final position and before consonants, the /ʀ/ is vocalised to either [ɐ̯ ] or [ɐ], e.g. Vater [ˈfɑːtɛɐ̯ ] or [ˈfɑːtɐ] ‘father’ or Kirche [ˈkIɐ̯ xɛ]6 ‘church’. Preceding /ʀ/, the vowel quality of [+constricted]7 vowels usually changes to [–constricted], before r-vocalisation takes place, e.g. Moor [mɔɐ̯ ]8 ‘bog’. Reduction of the sequence er to [ɐ] is only allowed in unstressed prefixes, e.g. verkaufen [fɛɐ̯ ˈkɑɔ̯ fɱ̩] or [fɐˈkɑɔ̯ fɱ̩] ‘to sell’. However, reduction to [ɐ] is not allowed in prefixes without consonantal onset, e.g. erlauben [ɛɐ̯ ˈlɑɔ̯ bm̩ ]9 ‘to allow’. Following /ɑ/, /ʀ/ is vocalised as well, however, the result of vocalisation, [ɐ̯ ], is absorbed, e.g. Parlament [pɑːlɑˈmɛnt] ‘parliament’, rar [ʀɑː] ‘scarce’. In intervocalic position, /ʀ/ is preserved. Again, in case of a preceding [+constricted] vowel, a change in vowel quality takes place and [ɐ̯ ] emerges, e.g. Lehrer [ˈlɛɐ̯ ʀɐ] ‘teacher’.

  - Basque's two rhotics only contrast when between vowels, where the trill is written as -rr- and the tap as -r-. When a suffix is added to a word ending in -r, a trill is generally used, as in ederrago 'more beautiful', from eder 'beautiful' and -ago. There is a small number of words which are exceptions to this rule, with de Rijk listing the following ten common ones: zer, ezer, nor, inor, hor, paper, plater, plazer, ur, and zur.[61]
  - Unless they are recent loanwords (e.g. Ruanda "Rwanda", radar, robot ... ), words may not have initial ⟨r⟩. In older loans, initial r- took a prosthetic vowel, resulting in err- (Erroma "Rome", Errusia "Russia"), more rarely irr- (for example irratia "radio", irrisa "rice") and arr- (for example arrazional "rational").[66]

Unlike in Spanish, this neutralization in Basque is generally in favor of the trill. Neither rhotic is found in wordinitial position in the native lexicon, although the trill is found in a few recent borrowings from Spanish, e.g. r` adio ‘radio’. Notice also ro  ́ eri /ro ́ eɾi/ ‘drugstore’ < Sp. droguer ́ıa. Phonetically (also as in Spanish), rhotics are often realized without full contact, as approximants or fricatives.

Unlike Spanish, in pre-or-postconsonantal position the realization is a trilled [r̄] in many Basque dialects arto [ar̄to] 'corn', andre [andr̄e] 'woman'. In the spelling, the double grapheme indicated the trill [r̄] between vowels; r is a flap [r] intervocalically.  
  - Page 12 : Word-initially, the two rhotics, [r], [r̄] do not occur in native words. Assimilated borrowings from Spanish with initial [r̄] (orthographic r-) in the lender language undergo epenthesis, generally of [e-], although there is some variation.  
  - Page 40 : In many dialects, some long vowels may be created by the optional deletion of a consonant [... r] between two identical vowels [paratu], [paatu] 'to put'. In Arbizy, on the other hand, vowel lenght is a distinctve feature.  
  - Page 54 : GERNIKA  
              As in all other dialect, the rhotics are not found word-initially. The trill [r̄] only appears word initially in unassimilated borrowings. [...] In assimilated borrowings there is epenthesis. The epenthetic vowel is [e] more consistently than in other dialects.  
  - Page 76 : Flapping  
              In the variety ofOndarroa, intervocalic /d/ can optionally be realized as [r]. In this position, there is free variation between the two allophones [ð] and [r], although the [r] realization is preferred in rapid speech. This alternation, however, is limited to certain lexical domains, including seemingly all suffixation and cliticization of /d/-initial third person conjugated verbal forms; see (119a). On the other hand, across word-boundaries, outside of cliticization, and even across the members of a compound, only [ð] and never [r] can be the surface realization of intervocalic /d/, as shown in (119b):

  - Page 84 : If, after final-vowel truncation, the final consonant is /r/, it is changed to /l/:  
              The consonantal change in (8) reflects a historical change in the opposite direction, which changed I tor intervocalically:  
              (9) l > r / V_V  
              This historical change is readily observable in the treatment of Latin loans (the examples are from Mujika (l982a)):
              In contemporary Basque, however, rule (9) not only is not productive, but does not even reflect a lexical regularity, since words with intervocalic 0] are quite common . The lexical generalization that holds is, rather, that stems ending in /VrV/, not falling into the category to which rule (2) (Lowering) applies, change their /r/ into [1] in their derivational form. This is thus a case of historical rule inversion (cf. Vennemann (1972); see also Hyman (1975: 176-178)). This rule, like the other rules discussed above, can still be applied to new words which fulfil the necessary requirements, even though its application is by no means obligatory.  
  - Page 122 : The only coronal that is never affected by Affective Palatalization is the trill [r̄]. The other rhotic, the flap [r], shows a variable behaviour; it may become (j) or [ʎ], it may be deleted, or it may be unaffected.

La variation entre [rə], [ər] et [r̩]  est libre et dépend en partie de la rapidité du débit.

              -La force articulatoire de [r] dans le groupe /rC/ dépend de la nature de C:

              [examples]
              Dans les positions suivantes, /r/ comprend très rarement plus d'un seul battement: [ɾ]. Par contre, ce dernier peut varier librement, surtout dans un début rapide avec une fricative alvéolaire sonore ressemblant au [ɹ] anglais, mais avec très peu de frication, formant presque une semi-voyelle  [ɹ̯].
              - Cette variation libre avec [ɹ̯] est particulièrement fréquente devant /xl/ et /xr/. Dans ces cas, [ɹ̯] peut même varier librement avec [ø], s'amalgamant avec le /x/ suivant dans une fricative glottale sonore [ɦ] :

    Approximant 	central 				(r /ɹ/) 
    The pronunciation of the letter ⟨r⟩ varies nowadays: [ʁ] is used in the French-influenced standard language and, generally speaking, in the central parts of Lower Brittany (including the south of Trégor, the west of Vannetais and virtually all parts of Cornouaille) whereas [r] is the common realisation in Léon and often in the Haut-Vannetais dialect of central Morbihan (in and around the city of Vannes and the Pays de Pontivy), though in rapid speech mostly a tapped [ɾ] occurs. In the other regions of Trégor [ɾ] or even [ɹ] may be found.

  - RR — The digraph -rr-, depending on the variety of Sicilian, can be a long trill [rː] (hereafter transcribed without the length mark)[89] or a voiced retroflex sibilant [ʐː].[86] This innovation is also found under slightly different circumstances in Polish, where it is spelled -rz-, and in some Northern Norwegian dialects, where speakers vary between [ʐ] and [ɹ̝].[citation needed] At the beginning of a word, the single letter r is similarly always pronounced double,[clarification needed] though this is not indicated orthographically. This phenomenon, however, does not include words that start with a single r resulting from rhotacism or apheresis (see below), which should not be indicated orthographically to avoid confusion with regular double r.[citation needed]
  - Rhotacism and apheresis — This transformation is characterized by the substitution of single d by r. In Sicilian this is produced by a single flap of the tongue against the upper alveolar ridge [ɾ]. This phenomenon is known as rhotacism, that is, the substitution of r for another consonant; it is commonly found both in Eastern and Western Sicilian, and elsewhere in Southern Italy, especially in Neapolitan. It can occur internally, or it can affect initial d, in which case it should not be represented orthographically to avoid confusion with the regular r (see above). Examples : pedi ("foot") is pronounced [ˈpɛːɾɪ]; Madonna ("Virgin Mary") is pronounced [maˈɾɔnna]; lu diri ("to say it") is pronounced [lʊ ˈɾiːɾɪ].[93] Similarly, apheresis of some clusters may occur in certain dialects, producing instances such as 'ranni [ˈɾannɪ] for granni "big".

  - The distribution of the two rhotics /r/ and /ɾ/ closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, [r] appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring [ɾ] and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled [r] unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case [ɾ] appears.[104]

  - In some dialects, initial /l/ and /n/ are not distinguished. In Southwestern Mandarin, these sounds usually merge to /n/; in Lower Yangtze Mandarin,  they usually merge to /l/.[94]
People in many Mandarin-speaking areas may use different initial sounds where Beijing uses initial r- /ɻ/. Common variants include /j/, /l/, /n/ and /w/.[93]
  - Syllabic consonants

The syllables written in pinyin as zi, ci, si, zhi, chi, shi, ri may be described as a sibilant consonant (z, c, s, zh, ch, sh, r in pinyin) followed by a syllabic consonant (also known as apical vowel in classic literature):
    [ɹ̩ ~ z̩], a laminal denti-alveolar voiced continuant,[a] in zi, ci, si ([tsɹ̩ tsʰɹ̩ sɹ̩]);
    [ɻ̩ ~ ʐ̩], an apical retroflex voiced continuant,[a] in zhi, chi, shi, ri ([ʈʂɻ̩ ʈʂʰɻ̩ ʂɻ̩ ɻɻ̩]).

  - 3 endroits pour le trill en Chine : firstly, in the Xuanzhou small area of the Wu dialect region, secondly, in the Hubei small area and
part of the Hubei small area of the Southwest official dialect region, and thirdly, in part of the Yu southeast small area of the Central Plains official dialect region.
  - The presence of the popping tongue in the dialects of Jingdang can only be the result of the influence of languages outside the Sino-Tibetan family.

Also, the constriction is narrower and the velocity of air greater. This sound often starts as a trill but continues as a fricative and thus probably the best term for it is 'alveolar trill

  - The phoneme represented by the letter ř (capital Ř) is very rare among languages and often claimed to be unique to Czech, though it also occurs in some dialects of Kashubian, and formerly occurred in Polish.[39] It represents the raised alveolar non-sonorant trill (IPA: [r̝]), a sound somewhere between Czech r and ž (example: "řeka" (river)   (help·info)),[40] and is present in Dvořák. In unvoiced environments, /r̝/ is realized as its voiceless allophone [r̝̊], a sound somewhere between Czech r and š.[41]  
  - The consonants /r/, /l/, and /m/ can be syllabic, acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel. Strč prst skrz krk ("Stick [your] finger through [your] throat") is a well-known Czech tongue twister using syllabic consonants but no vowels.[42]

  - Approximant  ʁ  
  - In onset /r/ is realized as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant, [ʁ], but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic low central vowel, [ɐ̯] or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the r in German or in non-rhotic pronunciations of English. The Danish realization of /r/ as guttural – the so-called skarre-r – distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled [r]. Only very few, middle-aged or elderly, speakers of Jutlandic retain a frontal /r/ which is then usually realised as a flapped [ɾ] or approximant [ɹ].   

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_phonology  
  - Syllable-initially, /r/ is a voiced uvular fricative [ʁ] or, more commonly, an approximant [ʁ̞].[25] According to Nina Grønnum, the fricative variant is voiceless [χ].[26] Its precise place of articulation has been described as pharyngeal,[27] or more broadly, as "supra-pharyngeal".[28] When emphasizing a word, word-initial /r/ may be realized as a voiced uvular fricative trill [ʀ̝].[16] In syllable-final position, /r/ is realized as [ɐ̯].[2]  
The alveolar realization [r] of /r/ is very rare. According to Torp (2001), it occurs in some varieties of Jutlandic dialect, and only for some speakers (mostly the elderly). The alveolar realization is considered non-standard, even in classical opera singing – it is probably the only European language in which this is the case.[29] According to Basbøll (2005), it occurs (or used to occur until recently) in very old forms of certain conservative dialects in Northern Jutland and Bornholm.[30]

The phonological system of Belgian Dutch has free variation between an alveolar and uvular trill. The alveolar trill is most frequent and geographically most widely distributed. The uvular trill is regionally confined to the cities of Ghent and Brussels and the province of Limburg, but estimates suggest that it is gaining fast in popularity (Van Reenen 1994). The alveolar/uvular trill is voiced in all positions, except word-finally as in [do:R9] ‘through’ and when followed by a voiceless stop in consonant clusters as in [va:R9t] ‘sails’. The phonetic characteristics of the uvular trill in the province of Limburg were investigated in Verhoeven (1994). It was found that uvular trills are virtually always realised with a clear transitional aspect of articulation, i.e. the uvula does actually trill against the back of the tongue. Only in a very small number of cases the uvular trill was realised phonetically as a voiced uvular approximant or a voiceless uvular fricative, i.e. without a transitional aspect. This limited phonetic variability of r-realisation in Belgian Dutch contrasts with the Netherlands where /r/ is also frequently realised as amongst others a central vowel, a retroflex approximant, an alveolar tap, an alveolar approximant or a uvular fricative (Van de Velde 1994).

The most frequent variants are the apicoalveolar fricative trill [r6], the apicoalveolar fricative [®6], and an apicoalveolar affricate [ɾ®6]; the last two variants tend to become voiceless in pre-pausal position (cf. Whitley 2003).

  - Rhotic 		r  
  - The realization of /r/ phoneme varies considerably from dialect to dialect and even between speakers in the same dialect area:  
    The historically original pronunciation is an alveolar trill [r], with the alveolar flap [ɾ] as a common allophone.  
    The uvular trill [ʀ] is a common alternative, found particularly in the central and southern dialect areas. Uvular pronunciations appear to be gaining ground in the Randstad.[16] Syllable-finally, it may be vocalized to [ɐ], much as in German. This is more common in the (south)eastern areas (Limburg, southeast Brabantian, Overijssel).
    The coastal dialects of South Holland produce a voiced uvular fricative [ʁ].  
    The velar bunched approximant [ɹ̈] (the Gooise R, which sounds similar to the retroflex approximant) is found at the end of a syllable in the pronunciation of some speakers in the Netherlands, especially those from the Randstad, but not in Belgium. Its use has been increasing in recent years.[17]

  - Trill r 					  
  - Tap ɾ  
  - The flap /ɾ/ has a trilled allophone [r] at the beginning of a word;[16] otherwise, they contrast between vowels wherein a trill occurs as a result of gemination (doubling) of [ɾ], especially in loanwords of Arabic origin. Only [ɾ] occurs before and after consonants; in word-final position, it is usually a free variation between a flap or a trill when followed by a consonant or a pause, but flap is more common, only flap before vowel-initial words. An approximant [ɹ] also occurs as an allophone of /ɾ/ before /t, d, s, z, ʃ, l, ʒ/; [ɹ] is sometimes in free variation with [ɾ] in these and other positions, such that فارسی ('Persian') is pronounced [fɒːɹˈsiː] or [fɒːɾˈsiː] and سقرلات ('scarlet') [sæɣeɹˈlɒːt] or [sæɣeɾˈlɒːt]. /r/ is sometimes realized as a long approximant [ɹː].

  - Page 30:  
  The rhotic /r/  
  It is not straightforward to determine the main allophone of /r/. Traditionally, it  
  has been stated that the main allophone is a trill, but recent investigations suggest  
  that the tap pronunciation ([ɾ]) is much more common than has been previously    
  presumed. Thus Mustanoja & O’Dell (2007) observed, in two corpora (colloquial  
  speech in Tampere and news broadcasts of the national broadcasting company)  
  that a great majority of the single /r/ productions in word-medial intervocalic  
  position were taps (75% and 90% in the two corpora, respectively). It seems   
  however that in other positions, e.g. word-initially, a trill realisation is more  
  common than the tap. Also the quantity opposition has an effect on the realisation  
  of /r/. Thus, as just mentioned, a single /r/ (as in paras ‘best’) is often realised as  
  [ɾ], but double /rr/ (as in parras ‘edge’) always as [r:], often with several closure  
  periods. On the whole, it seems legitimate to conclude that the main allophone of  
  /r/ is [r].  
  
  In addition, /r/ has an alveolar fricative allophone, [®3]. As was mentioned  
  above in discussing the allophones of /s/, the sequence /sr/ does not occur inside  
  native uncompounded words. A very likely reason for this avoidance is that the  
  sequence of the main allophones of the two phonemes, i.e. [sr], a sequence  
  consisting of a sibilant and a trill, is difficult to pronounce even for a native  
  phonetician. However, the phoneme sequence /sr/ is common across a word  
  boundary, and across a boundary between the parts of compound words. One way  
  of avoiding the pronunciation difficulty in e.g. Israel is that the allophonic  
  sequence [s®3] is chosen. Another way, mentioned earlier, is to choose the  
  allophonic sequence [xr]. Thus, the difficult sequence sibilant + trill is avoided  
  either by replacing the trill by a fricative rhotic, or by replacing the sibilant by a  
  non-sibilant fricative. The sequence [x®3] is not attested. The following account of  
  the allophones of /r/ is somewhat tentative:  
  [rule]  
  - Page 31 : In addition to these allophones proper, /r/ has more marginal realisations that  
  occur in some speakers’ idiolects, realisations that are not dialectal properties nor  
  due to segmental context. These include [®] and [“]. There is very little areal  
  variation in the regular allophones of /r/, but in the Tampere area their place of  
  articulation is further back than in other dialects, probably apical retroflex  
  (Kuronen 2000).  
  - Page 57 : /l/ and /s/ cannot be followed by /r/. Presumably both restrictions have a  
  similar articulatory motivation: /r/ requires an activity of the tongue blade  
  that is difficult to accomplish after /l/ and /s/. Exceptions: loanwords like  
  Kilroy, Israel. The reverse sequences /rl/ and /rs/ in turn are common. Recall  
  from above that the sequence /sr/ (which is common across a word boundary  
  and across the boundary between the components of compound words) has  
  the alternative pronunciations [xr] and [s®3 ]. Thus in the /sr/ sequence both  
  phonemes are realised, but in such a way that a sibilant is not followed by a   
  trill. In fact, this is a kind of phonetic sandhi restriction: the phonemic   
  affiliations of the consonants do not change, but if the occurring allophone of  
  one of the consonants is a sibilant or a trill, then the other consonant must be  
  realised by an allophone that does not occur elsewhere.

              French has one rhotic, whose production varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. The speaker presented here uses a uvular fricative [ʁ] that is
sometimes reduced to an approximant [ʁ̞], particularly in final position; it may also be devoiced (for examples see the transcribed text), and can be reduced to zero in some
word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill [ʀ] is also fairly common, and an apical trill [r] occurs in some dialects. Vowels are often lengthened before this segment.

  - Page 255 : Tap/Trill ɾ/r
  - Page 261 : Although it has been claimed that the Georgian /r/ may be ‘rolled’, this does not seem to be the case for the present speaker (Hewitt 2005: 5). In our tokens, the average closure duration for an intervocalic /r/ is quite short, on the order of 20 ms, and there is little evidence for sustained trilling in the audio signal. While the two brief reductions in oral flow observed in figure 5 may be indicative of a two-strike trill, it is probably safe to say that taps, not multiple-strikes, are the pronunciation norm in Standard Georgian.

  - r. Georgian r is generally formed by a single flap of the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge [ɾ]. It is very similar to the r in Spanish pe/r/o 'but' or the Russian r in [Word in Russian]   'break'. Between voiceless consonants it may become voiceless or drop completely.

  - Liquid r 	

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_German_phonology
  - Liquid r 	
  - /r/ can be uvular, alveolar or even dental, a consonant or a semivowel, see below.
  - /r/ has a number of possible realizations:
    Voiced apical coronal trill [r̺],[58][59][60] either alveolar (articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge),[58][59][60] or dental (articulated with the tip of the tongue against the back of the upper front teeth).[58]
    Distribution: Common in the south (Bavaria and many parts of Switzerland and Austria), but it is also found in some speakers in central and northern Germany, especially the elderly. It is also one of possible realizations of /r/ in the Standard Austrian accent, but a more common alveolar realization is an approximant [ɹ]. Even more common are uvular realizations, fricatives [ʁ ~ χ] and a trill [ʀ].[61]
    Voiced uvular trill [ʀ],[58][59][62][63] which can be realized as voiceless [ʀ̥] after voiceless consonants (as in treten).[59] According to Lodge (2009) it is often a flap [ʀ̆] intervocalically (as in Ehre).[64]
    Distribution: Occurs in some conservative varieties - most speakers with a uvular /r/ realize it as a fricative or an approximant.[65] It is also one of possible realizations of /r/ in the Standard Austrian accent, but it is less common than a fricative [ʁ ~ χ].[61]
    Dorsal continuant, about the quality of which there is not a complete agreement:
    Krech et al. (2009) describe two fricative variants, namely post-palatal [ɣ˖] and velar [ɣ]. The post-palatal variant appears before and after front vowels, while the velar variant is used in all other positions.[66]
    Morciniec & Prędota (2005) describe it as voiced post-velar fricative [ʁ̟].[67]
    Mangold (2005) and Kohler (1999) describe it as voiced uvular fricative [ʁ];[58][68]
    Mangold (2005) states that "with educated professional radio and TV announcers, as with professional actors on the stage and in film, the [voiced uvular] fricative [realization of] /r/ clearly predominates."[58]
    In the Standard Austrian accent, the uvular fricative is also the most common realization, although its voicing is variable (that is, it can be either voiced [ʁ] or voiceless [χ]).[61]
    Kohler (1999) writes that "the place of articulation of the consonant varies from uvular in e.g. rot ('red') to velar in e.g. treten ('kick'), depending on back or front vowel contexts." He also notes that [ʁ] is devoiced after voiceless plosives and fricatives, especially those within the same word, giving the word treten as an example. According to this author, [ʁ] can be reduced to an approximant in an intervocalic position.[69]
    Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996) describe it as a uvular fricative [ʁ] or approximant [ʁ̞]. The latter is less likely to occur word-initially.[70]
    Distribution: Almost all areas apart from Bavaria and parts of Switzerland.
    Near-open central unrounded vowel [ɐ] is a post-vocalic allophone of (mostly dorsal) varieties of /r/. The non-syllabic variant of it is not always near-open or central; it is similar to either [ɑ] or [ə], depending on the environment.[67]
    distribution: Widespread, but less common in Switzerland.

  - Page 24 : The voiced member of this pair, /r/, is sometimes trilled with the back of the tongue tapping rapidly against the soft palate.  
              Most recordings however show a consistent fricative /r/ with the trill rare.  
              Arabic speakers have a tongue-trilled apical /r/ which is recommended by official bodies (the radio).[10]

  - Obstruents Fricative ɣ~ʁ  
  - Commonly transcribed /r/. This is usually pronounced as a uvular fricative or approximant [ʁ] or velar fricative [ɣ], and sometimes as a uvular [ʀ] or alveolar trill [r] or alveolar flap [ɾ], depending on the background of the speaker.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language  
  - Most Israelis today also merge /ʕ ħ/ with /ʔ χ/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [ʁ] or a voiced velar fricative [ɣ] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences.

  - Trill	r  
  Consonant gradation is a pattern of alternations between pairs of consonants that appears in the inflection of words. Consonant gradation in Inari Sami is more complex than that of other Sami languages, because of the effects of the unique stress pattern of Inari Sami. Like in other Sami languages, there is a distinction between the strong and weak grade, but a second factor is whether the consonants appear in the middle of a foot (FM) or in the juncture between two feet (FJ). In the latter case, consonants are often lengthened.

              1.4 Prefixes ber-, per-, ter- and circumfixes which have ber- or per- as their prefix component undergo the changes listed below:  
              The r of the prefix is lost under the following circumstances:  
              When the base begins with r:  
              ber- + renang −> berenang  
              per- + rusak −> perusak  
              ter + rasa −> terasa  
              When the base begins with the sound combination CerC, where C represents any consonant:  
              ber- + serta −> beserta  
              ber- + terbang + -an −> beterbangan  
              per- + kerja + -an −> pekerjaan  
              ter- + pergok −> tepergok  
              Loss of r before a base beginning with CerC is not entirely regular; in a few words it does not occur or is optional. Thus:  
              ter- + percaya −> tepercaya, terpercaya  
              Prefix ter- usually becomes te- with the bases lanjur and lantar. The ter- forms are regarded by some as substandard and are not listed in all dictionaries. In some dictionaries, te- is regarded as part of the base rather than as a prefix:  
              ter- + lanjur −> telanjur, terlanjur  
              ter- + lantar −> telantar, terlantar  
              With base ajar the r in ber- and per- is replaced by l:  
              ber- + ajar −> belajar  
              per- + ajar + -an −> pelajaran

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_phonology -> Page redirigée  

/r/ varies significantly across dialects. In addition, its position relative to schwa is ambiguous: kertas ('paper') may be pronounced [krəˈtas] or [kərəˈtas]. The trill /r/ is sometimes reduced to a single vibration when single, making it phonetically a flap [ɾ], so that the pronunciation of a single /r/ varies between trill [r], flap [ɾ] and, in some instances, postalveolar approximant [ɹ̠].

Initially, the /ɾˠ ɾʲ/ distinction has been neutralized to a voiced post-alveolar approximant [ɹ], which takes its coloring from the following vowel. In non-initial position, the velarized member can be realized as either [ɾˠ] or [ɹˠ]. The historical palatalized //, which in most other dialects is a palatalized tap or apico-postalveolar fricative, may also appear in Gaoth Dobhair as a voiced palatal fricative [ʝ] in non-initial position. For both palatalized and velarized taps there is often incomplete closure with considerable frication.

  - Page 199 : From an articulatory perspective, there was substantial variation in the characteristics of the rhotic sounds of our two informants. Although rhotics are often assumed to be trills, trilled variants are rather rare in the data. Considerable differences could also be observed between the two informants: Speaker M did not produce any trills, whereas in P’s performance, trilled variants constitute as many as 22.5% of tokens. Both participants regularly reduce the <r> sounds to approximants; however, many more approximants are found in M’s speech (62.5%), almost twice as many as in the data produced by Speaker P (33.75%). As for fricated variants, approximately one third of all tokens underwent frication and both subjects produced similar results, 32.5% and 27.5% respectively. Needless to say, palatalised rhotics are much more susceptible to frication as the raised dorsum narrows the channel through which the airstream passes, thus creating aerodynamic conditions conducive to friction. Finally, the data also include a number of tapped variants. Predictably, more taps (approximately 15%) can be found in Speaker P’s performance, as he also produced a number of trills. By comparison, in M’s speech, only 4.5% of rhotic tokens were taps.
  - Page 201 : As a matter of fact, neither of the speakers made a single word-initial trill, which is indicative of the weakness of Irish rhotics initially. 
  - Page 208 : Despite the fact that the phonetic data presented in the study were obtained from only two participants, several interesting conclusions can be drawn. First and foremost, one can observe a very strong tendency towards the two rhotics being quite weak from the articulatory point of view, as very few trilled and tapped variants, which require the production of a full closure, were found in the data. The Irish sounds are predominantly approximants or fricatives.

  - Liquid r  
  - The "r" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an apical central tap and a lateral approximant.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology  
  - Realization of the liquid phoneme /r/ varies greatly depending on environment and dialect. The prototypical and most common pronunciation is an apical tap, either alveolar [ɾ] or postalveolar [ɾ̠].[7][8][5] Utterance-initially and after /N/, the tap is typically articulated in such a way that the tip of the tongue is at first momentarily in light contact with the alveolar ridge before being released rapidly by airflow.[9][8] This sound is described variably as a tap, a "variant of [ɾ]", "a kind of weak plosive",[9] and "an affricate with short friction, [d̠ɹ̝̆]".[5] The apical alveolar or postalveolar lateral approximant [l] is a common variant in all conditions,[5] particularly utterance-initially[9] and before /i, j/.[7] According to Akamatsu (1997), utterance-initially and intervocalically (that is, except after /N/), the lateral variant is better described as a tap [ɺ] rather than an approximant.[9][10] The retroflex lateral approximant [ɭ] is also found before /i, j/.[7] In Tokyo's Shitamachi dialect, the alveolar trill [r] is a variant marked with vulgarity.[7] Other reported variants include the alveolar approximant [ɹ],[5] the alveolar stop [d], the retroflex flap [ɽ], the lateral fricative [ɮ],[7] and the retroflex stop [ɖ].[11]

  - Page 110 : Normally in Standard Japanese we have only one type of liquid consonant, the so-called apico-alveolar flap, as in bara [bɑ˹ɾɑ] ‘rose’. However, it actually seems that there are many individual variations of this: the flap can vary from an alveolar trill [r] to a retroflex flap [ɽ] or an alveolar lateral approximant [l]. In particular, the phoneme /r/ could be pronounced as an apico-alveolar trill with a strong vibration when the speaker wants to sound tough (Vance 2008, 89). This kind of sound is found in gangster slang, and it is not limited to Tōkyō’s dialect.
  - Page 111 : In the following examples we have an exchange of utterances between a man questioned at a police check and a policeman.10 Both pronounce the word yarō, but the policeman only uses it when quoting the offensive words directed at him by the man. In this case the phoneme /r/ is realized as an apico-alveolar flap [ɾ] [fig. 3], while the young man who wanted to offend the policeman uses the marked stressed alveolar trill [r] [fig. 4], as shown by the following instrumental analysis, where the repeated vibration of the trill is evident. The same man, protesting against an underhand body search, shouts that the behaviour of the police is disgusting. He says kimochi warui n da yo (‘It’s disgusting!’) and here again the phoneme /r/ in the adjective warui (‘bad’) is pronounced loudly, with a strong stress, as an alveolar trill [fig. 5].

  - Liquid 		ㄹ /l/ or /ɾ/ 	
  - /l/ becomes alveolar flap [ɾ] between vowels, and [l] or [ɭ] at the end of a syllable or next to another /l/. A written syllable-final 'ㄹ', when followed by a vowel or a glide (i.e., when the next character starts with 'ㅇ'), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes [ɾ]. 
  - Traditionally, /l/ was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before [j], and otherwise became /n/. However, the inflow of western loanwords changed the trend, and now word-initial /l/ (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either [ɾ] or [l].

  [Many interresting informations about the trill in Korean, I select only info on the discussion]
  - Page 15 : Perhaps the most surprising finding of our study is that the trill [r] appears in Korean, mostly in NK. To our knowledge, no literature has reported the occurrence of a trill in Korean. NK speakers produced more trill and obstruent variants than SK speakers. One possible explanation of the trill realization in NK is that it is triggered by second language experience. North Korea was provisionally under the rule of the Soviet Union after the end of World War II and had close political and economic relationships afterwards. A number of Russian words were borrowed into NK vocabulary, and as mentioned earlier, Russian was taught as an official second language in school until the mid-1980s in North Korea. Therefore, we speculate that NK speakers were exposed to Russian [r] and adopted it in word-initial / L/ in their native language. The age effect in the realization of the trill can also be explained by this second language hypothesis; older NK speakers who learned Russian at school used the trill more frequently than younger NK speakers who did not. Younger speakers instead produced more tap and obstruent variants in place of the trill. This conjecture is supported by the fact that NK speakers produced trill more frequently in loanwords used in North Korea (15.0%) than in the Sino-Korean words (9.8%) or in the loans used in South Korea (9.7%).
    The trill, however, was also observed, although much less frequently, in the speech of the SK participants, who had never learned Russian or other languages with a trill. 12 of the 20 SK speakers produced one or more tokens of trill, and trill is not an idiosyncrasy of a few speakers. Notably, however, 27 of the 36 trill tokens SK speakers produced are found in words of NK origin, i.e., words that are only found in Sino-Korean words presented in NK spelling or loanwords primarily used in NK. This lexical conditioning suggests that SK speakers’ trill realization is likely a case of hyperarticulation. Tap [ɾ] is generally assumed to be the default form of the word-initial /L/, and we found it to be the most frequent variant in our study as well. SK speakers, who are unfamiliar with these Sino-Korean words written in North Korean orthography, attempt to produce the tap with a brief contact to the alveolar ridge, and may overshoot it, sometimes ending up with the trill with repeated contact. The fact that there are languages, such as Anyula and Tagalog, in which the tap may become the trill in emphatic contexts (Inouye, 1995) may also support this hypothesis. Alternatively, SK speakers themselves may implicitly be aware of the trill as an NK trait and adopt this variant in their production of NK words. We do not have evidence to tease apart these two possibilities and leave this question for future research.
  - Page 16 : For trill, we found a puzzling effect of LOR on trill in the opporite direction; NK speakers who have been in South Korea longer produce the trill more frequently than NK speakers with a short LOR. We conjecture that this is an epiphenomenon of the NK-internal sound change of less use of the trill. NK speakers who left the North early may maintain the former trend with more occurrences of the trill. Since then the trill became less frequently used within the dialect, and so NK speakers who left the North recently reflect the recent trend with the reduced use of the trill. Therefore, the LOR effect in the trill realization may be confounded with the dialect-internal sound change, and it would not necessarily be counter-evidence to the LOR hypothesis. Nevertheless, the lack of dialect contact effect for trill is unexpected, given the dialect difference. One possibility is that the AGE effect on trill is itself a manifestation of dialect contact, where younger speakers are more pliable to change toward the new dialect norm. However, this explanation does not account for the unexpected direction of LOR effect.
  [...]
  Another possible explanation for the puzzling effect of LOR on trill production is the dialect-internal variation. If our interpretation of the AGE on the NK trill usage is on the right track, the use of trill is declining within NK, and to NK speakers, the trill usage may be more salient as a marker of NK speakers’ AGE than a marker of NK dialect. Note that this explanation may seem to contradict the suggestion in the literature (Bowie, 2000; Walker, 2014) that features which exhibit internal variation in the native dialect are more susceptible to change under dialect contact. We do not have relevant evidence to choose between these two explanations.

Kurdish shows a contrast between the apical flap r, as in kër ‘donkey’, and the apical trill ř , as in këř ‘deaf’. They contrast intervocalically in kërë ‘he is a donkey’ and këřë ‘he is deaf’. A sequence of two flaps is equivalent to a trill, as in ÷ënerret ‘it will be sent’. In word-initial position, only the trill occurs.

  - Rhotic 		ɾ 		r
  - Kurdish has two rhotic sounds; the alveolar flap (/ɾ/) and the alveolar trill (/r/). While the former is alveolar, the latter has an alveo-palatal articulation.[10]
  
  [10] Rahimpour, Massoud; Dovaise, Majid Saedi (2011), "A Phonological Contrastive Analysis of Kurdish and English", International Journal of English Linguistics, 1 (2): 75, (pp. 75–76.)
  - Page 75 : .6 Retroflexes
Kurdish has two retroflex sounds: / r, ř /. They have alveolar and alveo-palatal articulation respectively and both are voiced. /r/ is flap (tap): it is produced by making a single tap of the tongue. /ř/ is trill (roll): it is produced by a series of taps by the tongue. For the meaning-distinguishing feature of these two phonemes one can notice the contrast between the minimal pairs bar (the front part) versus bař (a kind of coarse carpet) and drâw (money) versus dřâw (ragged). The tap /r/ never occurs initially. The trill one can occur in all three positions: initially,
medially and finally.

  - In Classical Latin, the rhotic /r/ was most likely an alveolar trill [r]. Gaius Lucilius likens it to the sound of a dog, and later writers describe it as being produced by vibration. In Old Latin, intervocalic /z/ developed into /r/ (rhotacism), suggesting an approximant like the English [ɹ], and /d/ was sometimes written as /r/, suggesting a tap [ɾ] like Spanish single r.[21]

It is possible to have minimal or near minimal pairs with vocalic /r/ between a vowel and consonant when the vowel preceding vocalic /r/ is a morpheme boundary: porti - po'rti 'doors' - 'begin to sprout'. However, the realization of vocalic /r/ can be [ăr] (see 1.2.1.3).

In the recording, [r] occurs word-initially in rapat [rapatâ], and in codas in sinarnya [sinar ̄a] ‘its light’ and at the end of   bertengkar [bRt ́Nkhar] ‘fight’, while [R] occurs intervocalically in matahari [matåhaRi] ‘sun’ and as a syllable nucleus in tersebut [tR`s ́bUt] ‘aforesaid’.

In our data, it is realized as a short (two- or three-tap) trill [r] or sometimes as a single tap [|] at the beginning of the word, but as a single tap or flap when intervocalic or at the end of the word. These differences may reflect inter-speaker variation. We take the word-initial trill variant [r] as the basic variant of this phoneme, consistent with our practice elsewhere, but it should be kept in mind that the Nepali trills are weaker than Spanish or Italian trills. Geminate /r/ is fully trilled and, in this case, the trill is quite strong.  
/rato/ ‘red’ /tir/ ‘arrow’   
/tara/ ‘star’ /sar/ ‘move’  
/tarro/ ‘bitter’  
A retroflex flap [ɽ] also occurs as a postvocalic variant of /ɖ/ as described above.

  - /ɖ ɖʱ/ are flapped ([ɽ]) in postvocalic position. /r/ is usually a trill [r] but may be a tap [ɾ] in intervocalic position.[8][9]   
  - Typically, sounds transcribed with the retroflex symbols ⟨ʈ, ʈʰ, ɖ, ɖʱ, ɽ, ɳ, ɽ̃⟩ are not purely retroflex [ʈ, ʈʰ, ɖ, ɖʱ, ɽ, ɳ, ɽ̃] but apical postalveolar [t̠, t̠ʰ, d̠, d̠ʱ, ɾ̠, n̠, ɾ̠̃]. Some speakers may use purely retroflex sounds after /u/ and /a/, but other speakers use the apical articulation in all positions.[10]

  - Tap 		ɾ 		ɽ  
  - The realization of the rhotic /ɾ/ depends on the dialect. In Eastern, Central, and Northern Norwegian dialects, it is a tap [ɾ], whereas in Western and Southern Norway, and for some speakers also in Eastern Norway, it is uvular [χ] or [ʁ]. And in the dialects of North-Western Norway, it is realized as [r], much like the trilled ⟨rr⟩ of Spanish.

  - Page 24 : The retroflex flap [] is found in eastern and northern dialects of Norwegian as well as in a number of Swedish dialects. It is articulated by moving the apex rapidly forward from a retroflexed position, hitting the alveolar ridge momentarily on its way towards the lower teeth. Historically it derives both from Old Norse /rð/ and /l/, the former probably being the environment where it originated due to similarity of articulatory movement. Its phonemic status is precarious. In most roots where it may occur, it can alternate with [ɾ] in words where Old Norse had /rð/ and with [l] where Old Norse had /l/. Examples are []/[], bord ‘table’ and []/[], sol ‘sun’.23, 24 But there are words that can only be pronounced with [], such as [], møl,25 which contrasts minimally with [], mør ‘tender’.  
  - Page 24 Note 21 : An example is [], rar ‘funny’. It can occasionally also be realized as a trill, for instance in emphatic speech. Uvular (or velar) realization may occur in two distinct sub-populations of UEN-speakers. It is used by some older, upper-class Oslo speakers, probably a vestige of an aborted change from apical to uvular pronunciation that seems to have taken place earlier this century. Uvular pronunciation can also be heard among speakers who have not managed to acquire the more complex apical articulation.

  - Tap/trill 		r ^ [d]  
  - [d] The /r/ phoneme is alternatively transcribed /ɾ/.  
  - /r/ is apical alveolar. It has been traditionally classified as a trill [r̺], with a tap [ɾ̺] supposedly only occurring as an allophone or in fast speech.[77] However, more recent studies show that /r/ is predominantly realized as a tap [ɾ̺], sometimes as an approximant or a fricative, but almost never as a trill.[78][79] One study found that in an intervocalic context a trilled [r] occurs in less than 3% of cases, while a tapped [ɾ] occurred in approximately 95% of cases. Another study by the same researcher showed that in a postconsonantal position, /r/ is realized as a tapped [ɾ] in 80–90% of cases, while trilled [r] occurs in just 1.5% of articulations.[80] A palatalized laminal tap [ɾ̻ʲ] is used before /i, j/ in recent loanwords.[76]

In intervocalic position there is a phonemic contrast between the so-called strong and weak ‘r’s’, /r/ vs. /|/. While the latter phoneme is always realised as a tap ([ɾ]) in this position, the former varies considerably across the Brazilian territory. In the variety described here, it is a velar fricative, usually voiced between voiced sounds and voiceless elsewhere (which justifies the use of the symbol [ɣ] to indicate the realisation of /r/). It can nevertheless be realised as a glottal fricative, usually in weak prosodic positions, particularly in casual speech.  
In coda position, four archiphonemes are allowed in BP: /R/, /S/, /N/, /L/ (cf. D’Angelis’ (2002) reanalysis of Cˆamara’s (1970) treatment of the issue).  
As regards /R/, its phonetic realisation is extremely variable in BP, and it may even include a tap. Within the framework of Labovian sociolinguistics, Callou, Moraes & Leite (1996) showed, on the basis of phonetically transcribed data, that an isogloss for /R/ realisations can be established between the States of S˜ao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro: a higher frequency of the tap from S˜ao Paulo southwards, as opposed to a higher frequency of the velar and glottal fricatives from Rio de Janeiro northwards (this result still awaits confirmation by means of instrumental phonetic analysis). The tap is the preferred realisation for /R/ in the variety presented here. In infinitives, however, this sound usually drops word-finally except if followed by a vowel.

  - The consonant hereafter denoted as /ʁ/ has a variety of realizations depending on dialect. In Europe, it is typically a uvular trill [ʀ]; however, a pronunciation as a voiced uvular fricative [ʁ] may be becoming dominant in urban areas. There is also a realization as a voiceless uvular fricative [χ], and the original pronunciation as an alveolar trill [r] also remains very common in various dialects.[166] A common realization of the word-initial /r/ in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular fricative trill [ʀ̝].[167] In Brazil, /ʁ/ can be velar, uvular, or glottal and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds.[168] It is usually pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative [x], a voiceless glottal fricative [h] or voiceless uvular fricative [χ].

  - R
I am by no means a specialist in phonetics, but as a native Romanian speaker, I just realized that I pronounce 'r' more like what seems to me to be an alveolar tap. I think this is more general though. Shouldn't we then transcribe the Romanian 'r' phonetically as 'ɾ', since 'r' in IPA would be an alveolar trill? Waardijner 00:16, 6 June 2007 (UTC)  
    There is a basic difference between trills and taps (see Trill consonant and Flap consonant for details). Romanian /r/ is a trill, because the tongue is just placed against the alveolar ridge and it's the air flow that moves the tongue, whereas in a tap the tongue is moved by its own muscles. Romanian /r/ is indeed most of the time pronounced with a single period, which makes it similar to a tap, but trills don't necessarily have more than one period. Besides, Romanian /r/ can be pronounced with more than one period --- that is, it can be an unquestionable alveolar trill --- without a change in meaning (thus single- and multiple-period realizations of /r/ are allophones in Romanian), as opposed for example to Spanish where there are minimal pairs such as caro vs. carro. Note that taps can never have more than one period.  
    All works on Romanian phonology and phonetics use the symbol r for this sound, both phonetically and phonologically. — AdiJapan ☎ 04:14, 6 June 2007 (UTC)  
        Thanks for explaining that. It looks like I need a lot more practising. I wonder still: were somebody to use a ɾ, would it be noticeable in any immediate way to other speakers? Waardijner 13:00, 6 June 2007 (UTC)  
    Not really, at least to most listeners. If a speaker used an alveolar flap instead of a trill, probably the possibility of confusion between /r/ and /l/ would be slightly higher (because /l/ is a sort of flap), so rac might sound a bit like lac, but otherwise you could still have a comfortable conversation with that speaker. Personally I haven't met anyone to pronounce /r/ as a flap though. Actually many of us have some kind of small speech defects, but we get used to ignoring them, both as speakers and as listeners. As you probably know, quite a few Romanians use the uvular trill for /r/ (Nicolae Ceauşescu and Nicu Alifantis come to mind), and other than sounding a bit "funny", phonologically speaking there is no problem. — AdiJapan ☎ 14:57, 6 June 2007 (UTC)  
    I agree (as a native speaker), though I suspect it's harder to pronounce consonant sequences like “tr” with a tap than with a trill. (I can't seem to figure out how to do it myself; trying to do it leads to a trill by instinct. If it's possible, it might sound a bit strange.)

  - Page 120 : The Russian /r/ and /r,/ are usually pronounced with a trill. These trills are about 40 to 70 msecs long, and not more than one is needed to give proper identification (see Fig. V-7). The sound is thus made up of two separate parts, one of which is primarily vowel-like and the other either a silence or a noise. In order to perceive a good trilled [r] it is necessary that both parts be present. There are, however, examples where no trill can be observed, and the phoneme contains much noise, (see Fig. V-6).   
                In the vocalic part of [r], the formants are less clearly defined than in the vowels, and the intensity of the frequency band between 600 cps and 1500 cps is much greater relative to the first formant than in the nasals and in most vowels. In a few cases we observed a peak at 1500 cps; there were, however, other cases in which no energy
maxima in this region could be found. The best way to describe the vocalic parts of the [r] is to say that they resemble most the neutral vowel [A], strongly influenced by
the adjacent phonemes (cf., Fig. V-7).  
                In view of the evolution of Common Slavic palatal [r] into strident /r chapeau inversé/ as in Czech and subsequently into /z chapeau inversé/ as in Polish, Slavicists will be interested to learn that we found several cases in which the segment corresponding to the closure (noise) when played in isolation gave a distinct [z chapeau inversé] impression. All these were instances of the sharped /r,/.

  - ऋ 	ṛ/r̥ 	/r̩/
  - According to Masica, Sanskrit has four traditional semivowels, with which were classed, "for morphophonemic reasons, the liquids: y, r, l, and v; that is, as y and v were the non-syllabics corresponding to i, u, so were r, l in relation to r̥ and l̥".[220] The northwestern, the central and the eastern Sanskrit dialects have had a historic confusion between "r" and "l". The Paninian system that followed the central dialect preserved the distinction, likely out of reverence for the Vedic Sanskrit that distinguished the "r" and "l". However, the northwestern dialect only had "r", while the eastern dialect probably only had "l", states Masica. Thus literary works from different parts of ancient India appear inconsistent in their use of "r" and "l", resulting in doublets that are occasionally semantically differentiated.[220]

  - Page 374 : The long lateral and the long trill are often considered to be allophones of /l/ and /r/, respectively (see e.g. ˇDuroviˇc 1975; Short 1993, 2000) because there are no minimal pairs for /lː/ and /l/ or /rː/ and /r/. However, the two pairs are not in complementary distribution: the long lateral and the long rhotic can only occur in the syllable nucleus, their short counterparts in the nucleus and elsewhere. For this reason we follow Bujalka, Balaz  & Ryyzkova (1996: 42) in considering all four sounds phonemes. Short /r/ is in the majority of the cases realized as a tap [ɾ] (Isacenko 1968: 185; Palvik 2004), but some instances show two closure phases.

  - There is one trill consonant. Originally, this was an alveolar rolled lingual, but today most individuals pronounce it at the back of the tongue, usually at the uvular position. The uvular pronunciation is largely attributed to the influence of French missionaries at Morija in Lesotho. Just like the French version, the position of this consonant is somewhat unstable and often varies even in individuals, but it generally differs from the "r"'s of most other South African language communities. The most stereotypical French-like pronunciations are found in certain rural areas of Lesotho, as well as some areas of Soweto (where this has affected the pronunciation of Tsotsitaal).

[...]  
               Linked to this is the specific behaviour of syllable coda /ɾ/ followed by syllable onset /l/ acting as codas and heads of a syllable. One of the most noticeable characteristics of Murcian is the full assimilation of /ɾ/ to /l/ [...]

  - Flap ɾ
  - Trill r
  - The Spanish consonant system is characterized by [...] a phonemic distinction between the "tapped" and "trilled" r-sounds (single ⟨r⟩ and double ⟨rr⟩ in orthography). 

Martínez-Celdrán, Eugenio; Fernández-Planas, Ana Ma.; Carrera-Sabaté, Josefina (2003). "Castilian Spanish". Journal of the International Phonetic Association. 33 (2): 255–59. doi:10.1017/S0025100303001373.

  - Flap ɾ
  - Trill r
  - Rhotics
    The alveolar trill [r] and the alveolar tap [ɾ] are in phonemic contrast word-internally between vowels (as in carro 'car' vs caro 'expensive'), but are otherwise in complementary distribution, as long as syllable division is taken into account: the tap occurs after any syllable-initial consonant, while the trill occurs after any syllable-final consonant.[47][48]  

Only the trill can occur word-initially (e.g. el rey 'the king', la reina 'the queen') or at the start of a word-internal syllable when the preceding syllable ends with a consonant, which is always the case after /l/, /n/, /s/ (e.g. alrededor, enriquecer, Israel).    

Only the tap can occur after a word-initial obstruent consonant (e.g. tres 'three', frío 'cold').    

Either a trill or a tap can be found after the word-medial obstruent consonants /b/, /d/, /t/, depending on whether the rhotic consonant is pronounced in the same syllable as the preceding obstruent (forming a complex onset cluster) or in a separate syllable (with the obstruent in the coda of the preceding syllable). For example, the words subrayar, ciudadrealeño, postromántico have a trill.[49] Each of these words has a morpheme boundary coinciding with the syllable division before the rhotic consonant; the trills correspond to the word-initial trills found in raya 'line', Ciudad Real "Ciudad Real", and romántico "Romantic". The tap is found in words where there is no syllable boundary between the obstruent and the following rhotic consonant, such as sobre 'over', madre 'mother', ministro 'minister'.    

In syllable-final position inside a word, the tap is more frequent, but the trill can also occur (especially in emphatic[50] or oratorical[51] style) with no semantic difference—thus arma ('weapon') may be either [ˈaɾma] (tap) or [ˈarma] (trill).[52] In word-final position the rhotic is usually:    

- either a tap or a trill when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in amo[ɾ ~ r] paterno ('paternal love'), the former being more common;[53]  
- a tap when followed by a vowel-initial word, as in amo[ɾ] eterno ('eternal love').  

Morphologically, a word-final rhotic always corresponds to the tapped [ɾ] in related words. Thus the word olor 'smell' is related to olores, oloroso 'smells, smelly' and not to \*olorres, \*olorroso.[35]  

When two rhotics occur consecutively across a word or prefix boundary, they result in one trill, so that da rocas ('s/he gives rocks') and dar rocas ('to give rocks') are either neutralized, or distinguished by a longer trill in the latter phrase.[54]  

The tap/trill alternation has prompted a number of authors to postulate a single underlying rhotic; the intervocalic contrast then results from gemination (e.g. tierra /ˈtieɾɾa/ > [ˈtjera] 'earth').[55][56][57]

  - Page 38 : Sonants : Non-nasals r
  - Page 39 : /r/ [r] alveolar trill; 
  - Page 44 : In colloquial speech, Swahili /r/ is commonly reflected by a short apico-alveolar trill, which can be reduced to a single tap. It accordingly appears regularly as an apico-alveolar flap[ɾ] in the pronunciation of many speakers.
              The phonemic status of /r/ versus /l/ is clearly evidenced by such minimal pairs as [...]
              It should, however, be pointed out that:
              (a) most of the lexical evidence for /r/ consists of loanwords, mainly from Arabic: these loanwords often belong to a rather technical vocabulary and may contrast with Bantu words with initial /l/,e.g., mrama 'rolling(of ship)' :mlama'kind of combretum used in snake-biter emedies';
              Upon closer examination, it seems probable that [r] was originally merely a free variant of [l]. In standard Swahili orthography either the form withr or the form with l may indifferently have been retained, hence r, e.g., in rungu 'club' orchura 'frog', also pronounced with [l]. However, the prevalence of definit espellings in cases of semantic differentiation led to the development of contrastiv epairs like linga 'measure, adjust, harmonize': ringa 'strut'. Whereas the alternation [l] [r] was originally dialectal in Bantu,the impact of Arabic influence made the distinction between /l/ and In phonemic and led to a rather arbitrary redistribution of l and r in words of Bantu stock, hence /r/ in refu 'long', kuruka 'to jump'
or zuri 'fine, nice'. Conversely, some Arabic loans showed alternate forms with [1]and [r],e.g., lasali 'cheat' [la'ya1] [ra'yl],risasi 'bullet' [ri'sa:81] [li'sa:sI].
    - Page 45 : [...] a typically Arabized pronunciatio nof Arabic loans can be heard. Its characteristic features are:         
                (6) a uvular articulation [R] of /r/, e.g., tahadhar(i) 'be careful' [tahadeR] ti [tahada:ri].

  - There are 18 consonant phonemes, two of which, /ɧ/ and /r/, vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker. In many dialects, sequences of /r/ (pronounced alveolarly) with a dental consonant result in retroflex consonants; alveolarity of the pronunciation of /r/ is a precondition for this retroflexion. /r/ has a guttural or "French R" pronunciation in the South Swedish dialects; consequently, these dialects lack retroflex consonants.[50]

  - Rhotic 		r  
  - /r/ has distinct variations in Standard Swedish. For most speakers, the realization as an alveolar trill occurs only in contexts where emphatic stress is used.[citation needed] In Central Swedish, it is often pronounced as a fricative (transcribed as [ʐ])[50] or approximant (transcribed as [ɹ]),[7] which is especially frequent in weakly articulated positions such as word-finally[29] and somewhat less frequent in stressed syllable onsets, in particular after other consonants.[50] It may also be an apico-alveolar tap.[29] One of the most distinct features of the southern varieties is the uvular realization of /r/, which may be a trill [ʀ],[51] a fricative [ʁ] or an approximant [ʁ̞]. In Finland, /r/ is usually an apical trill [r], and may be an approximant [ɹ] postvocalically.[52]

  - Page 244 : Trill r
               [...] there are several allophones of the phoneme /r/ – such as the alveolar tap [ɾ] and, more frequently, the uvular variants [ʀ], [ʁ], [ʁ̥ ]or[ʁ̞].
  - Page 249 : In some cases, a linking /r/ is introduced instead of /n/.
  
Wikipedia :   
  For standard german :
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_German_phonology
  - Liquid r 	
  - /r/ can be uvular, alveolar or even dental, a consonant or a semivowel, see below.
  - /r/ has a number of possible realizations:
    Voiced apical coronal trill [r̺],[58][59][60] either alveolar (articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge),[58][59][60] or dental (articulated with the tip of the tongue against the back of the upper front teeth).[58]
    Distribution: Common in the south (Bavaria and many parts of Switzerland and Austria), but it is also found in some speakers in central and northern Germany, especially the elderly. It is also one of possible realizations of /r/ in the Standard Austrian accent, but a more common alveolar realization is an approximant [ɹ]. Even more common are uvular realizations, fricatives [ʁ ~ χ] and a trill [ʀ].[61]
    Voiced uvular trill [ʀ],[58][59][62][63] which can be realized as voiceless [ʀ̥] after voiceless consonants (as in treten).[59] According to Lodge (2009) it is often a flap [ʀ̆] intervocalically (as in Ehre).[64]
    Distribution: Occurs in some conservative varieties - most speakers with a uvular /r/ realize it as a fricative or an approximant.[65] It is also one of possible realizations of /r/ in the Standard Austrian accent, but it is less common than a fricative [ʁ ~ χ].[61]
    Dorsal continuant, about the quality of which there is not a complete agreement:
    Krech et al. (2009) describe two fricative variants, namely post-palatal [ɣ˖] and velar [ɣ]. The post-palatal variant appears before and after front vowels, while the velar variant is used in all other positions.[66]
    Morciniec & Prędota (2005) describe it as voiced post-velar fricative [ʁ̟].[67]
    Mangold (2005) and Kohler (1999) describe it as voiced uvular fricative [ʁ];[58][68]
    Mangold (2005) states that "with educated professional radio and TV announcers, as with professional actors on the stage and in film, the [voiced uvular] fricative [realization of] /r/ clearly predominates."[58]
    In the Standard Austrian accent, the uvular fricative is also the most common realization, although its voicing is variable (that is, it can be either voiced [ʁ] or voiceless [χ]).[61]
    Kohler (1999) writes that "the place of articulation of the consonant varies from uvular in e.g. rot ('red') to velar in e.g. treten ('kick'), depending on back or front vowel contexts." He also notes that [ʁ] is devoiced after voiceless plosives and fricatives, especially those within the same word, giving the word treten as an example. According to this author, [ʁ] can be reduced to an approximant in an intervocalic position.[69]
    Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996) describe it as a uvular fricative [ʁ] or approximant [ʁ̞]. The latter is less likely to occur word-initially.[70]
    Distribution: Almost all areas apart from Bavaria and parts of Switzerland.
    Near-open central unrounded vowel [ɐ] is a post-vocalic allophone of (mostly dorsal) varieties of /r/. The non-syllabic variant of it is not always near-open or central; it is similar to either [ɑ] or [ə], depending on the environment.[67]
    distribution: Widespread, but less common in Switzerland.

      The phoneme /r/ is pronounced as an alveolar trill [r] in many dialects, but some dialects, especially in the Northeast or in the Basel region, have a uvular trill [ʀ], and other allophones resulting din fricatives and an approximant as [ʁ ʁ̥ ʁ̞] like in many German varieties of Germany.

Opinion is divided over whether this corresponds to a phonetic distinction in colloquial Tamil: Balasubramanian (1982a) argues that always corresponds phonetically to a tap, whilst [ɾ] and [r] are both possible realizations of ர, their distribution being determined in part by environment. Narayanan, Byrd and Kaun (1999) report a slight difference in place, rather than manner, of articulation, with ர pre-alveolar and  ற postalveolar. In most colloquial varieties, however, it seems that a merger is in progress, if not complete.

It behaves like stops in certain morphophonemic alternations like doubling beforecase markers (Schiffman, 1975).

This distinction is rather well maintained by some cultivated speakers, especially in formal speech; however, many show much vacillation, with a tendency to favor the lateral phone [l] in the position of a single initial consonant. As the second element of initial consonant clusters, both N and hi tend to be deleted altogether.

Its devoiced counterpart [ɾ̥] occurs in word-final position. /r/ is sometimes deleted in colloquial speech, in particular in the imperfective suffix -Iyor (see 8.2.3.3 for details) and in bir ‘a’, ‘one’. In the case of bir, this usually occurs when it is not stressed (bir ev [bi év] ‘a house’) but also sometimes
when it is stressed (bir daha [bída:] ‘again’, sadece bir ev ‘only one hourse')

  - Page 17 : 2.2 ALTERNATIONS OF SINGLE CONSONANTS WITH DOUBLE CONSONANTS  
              In a small number of nouns ending in ‘b’, ‘t’, ‘d’, ‘k’, ‘l’, ‘s’, ‘z’, ‘m’ and ‘n’ the final consonant is duplicated when a vowel is attached to it. These are words borrowed from Arabic, which, in their original roots, have geminates, i.e. doubled consonants. In Turkish such words appear with a single consonant in their bare form or when followed by a suffix beginning with a consonant.  
              sır ‘secret’  sırlar ‘secrets’  sırrımız  ‘our secret’  
              Some of these words keep their original double consonants when they combine with the auxiliaries et- ‘do’ and ol- ‘be’ (13.3.2): hallet- ‘solve’, hallol- ‘be solved’, hisset- ‘feel’. Others appear in nominal-verb compounds with a single consonant: hak et- ‘deserve’. It should be noted that since bare stems do not give any indication that they end in geminates, such words have to be learned individually. Nouns belonging to this class are indicated in dictionary entries in the form sır (-rrı), hat (-ttı), zıt (-ddı). The form of any nominal-verb compounds derived from these words also has to be checked in a dictionary.

  - /n, t, d, s, z/ are dental [n̪, t̪, d̪, s̪, z̪], /ɫ/ is velarized dental [ɫ̪], /ɾ/ is alveolar [ɾ], whereas /l/ is palatalized post-alveolar [l̠ʲ].[1][8]  
  - /ɾ/ is frequently devoiced word-finally and before a voiceless consonant.[3] According to one source,[9] it is only realized as a modal tap   intervocalically. Word-initially, a location /ɾ/ is restricted from occurring in native words, the constriction at the alveolar ridge narrows sufficiently to create frication but without making full contact, [ɾ̞]; the same happens in word-final position: [ɾ̞̊][9] (which can be mistaken for /ʃ/ or /ʂ/ by non-Turkish speakers).  
  - No word-initial /ɰ/ or /ɾ/ (in native words)  
  - In a complex coda: The first consonant is either a voiceless fricative, /ɾ/ or /l/

The letter r stands for a ‘rolling r’ (as in Scottish or Spanish) at the beginning of a syllable, but at the end of a word it is sounded with an extra rustle in the form of an h-like sound; that is, the final r receives strong aspiration. In this way, there is a clear audible difference between the r in the first two words and the r in the second pair of words.

  - The group of palatalized consonants consists of 10 phonemes: /j, dʲ, zʲ, lʲ, nʲ, rʲ, sʲ, tʲ, t͡sʲ, d͡zʲ/. All except /j/ have a soft and a hard variant. There is no agreement about the nature of the palatalization of /rʲ/; sometimes, it is considered as a semi-palatalized[clarification needed] consonant.[15]  
  - Unpalatalized dental consonants /n, t, d, t͡s, d͡z, s, z, r, l/ become palatalized if they are followed by other palatalized dental consonants /nʲ, tʲ, dʲ, t͡sʲ, d͡zʲ, sʲ, zʲ, rʲ, lʲ/.  
  - There are some typical deviations which may appear in spoken language (often under the influence of Russian).[20] They are usually considered phonetic errors by pedagogists.[21] : [rʲ] for /r/

  - In southern speech, the phoneme /ɺ/, generally represented in Vietnamese linguistics by the letter ⟨r⟩, has a number of variant pronunciations that depend on the speaker. More than one pronunciation may even be found within a single speaker. It may occur as a retroflex fricative [ʐ], an alveolar lateral flap [ɺ] (unrounded), a flap [ɾ] or a trill [r], especially in loanwords. Some rural speakers from Mekong Delta pronounced /ɺ/ as [ɣ] or [j], but this is not considered formal.

Consonants, vowels and tones across Vietnamese dialects
  - Page 122 : For example, the letter ‘‘r’’ is pronounced in the Standard and central dialects as the retroflex /œ/, northern dialect as the voiced alveolar fricative /z/ or the trilled /r/ and in the southern dialect as the voiced velar fricative /å/.
  - aage 124 : The trilled consonant /r/ is included as a Vietnamese initial consonant by one author (Hoang, 2004), but it is considered to be a variant identified in some local areas and in foreign loan words by others (ÐN & e, 2005; Ðoa`n, 2003). Therefore, in the current paper, two phonemes /?,p/ will be included as initial consonants in Standard Vietnamese and the phoneme /r/ will be excluded.
  - Page 127 : The trilled phoneme /r/ is considered to be a local variant identified in coastal areas (ÐN &Lˆ e, 2005) or in foreign loan words (Kirby, 2011).
  - Page 128 : According to Hoang (2004), the trilled phoneme /r/ occurs in the southern dialect, but it may also be substituted by /œ,z,j, å/ (e.g. rua (turtle) may be pronounced as /ruo2/, /œuo2/, /juo2/or/åuo2/).
  - Page 130 : Another difficulty relates to inconsistency in using Vietnamese phonetic symbols within an author’s writing and between authors. For example, the grapheme ‘‘th’’ has been transcribed as following phoneme symbols: /t’, t„},tk/. The grapheme ‘‘tr’’ has been transcribed as following phoneme symbols: /ô, Ô, T, f, Ô@/; and grapheme ‘‘r’’ has been transcribed as phoneme symbols: /Ñ, —,r,œ/. Therefore, it is ambiguous as to whether these should be count

  - Trill 		r ⟨r⟩ 	
  - All simple nasals, oral stops apart from q and glottal, and the sonorants l r y w may be geminated (doubled), though geminate r only occurs in ideophones.[20][21] (Geminate consonants are written double.)
  [20] Pape Amadou Gaye, Practical Cours in / Cours Practique en Wolof: An Audio–Aural Approach.
  [21] Some are restricted or rare, and sources disagree about this. Torrence (2013) claims that all consonants but prenasalized stops may be geminate, while Diouf (2009) does not list the fricatives, q, or r y w, and does not recognize glottal stop in the inventor. The differences may be dialectical or because some sounds are rare.
